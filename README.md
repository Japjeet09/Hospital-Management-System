# Hospital-Management-System
A website which offers several useful features that let users handle the hospital's documentation. The idea behind both this system and the web application is straightforward, consistent with real-world situations, and expertly executed. Specifically, handling hospital records is the primary focus of this Python Django hospital management system project. The system also shows all of the available appointments along with the relevant information. Furthermore, the technology facilitates the management of patient records. This project appears to be separated into three categories: admin panel, doctor, and patient. According to an overview, a patient only needs to register in order to begin using this web application. First, the administrator must approve the action. He or she must actually apply for it. However, the administrator must take action for each application, which is contingent on their approval or disapproval. By default, each patient must provide all relevant symptoms. The client can also examine their appointment and hospital expenses.
